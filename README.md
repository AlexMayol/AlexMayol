### Hello there, dear stranger 👀
![I love dogs!](https://placedog.net/1024/340?random)

My name is Alejandro and I love coding websites. It's been my job for nearly three years and you cand find some of the things I learnt during this time here, on my repositories.

I've been highly focused on **front-end** for most of my career. As you can tell by my profile, I love Vue and Tailwind and they've been boosting my productivity and enjoyment.

I've also started learning deno since I find it super easy and helpful for some tasks.

Currently I'm working with React and Next.js and I'm loving it!

So now that you know a little bit more about me, send me a message and let's stop being online stangers ✌️

Enjoy the puppies 💖💖
